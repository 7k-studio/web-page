# Deadalus v0.3.1beta
## Bugfixing

### Logger
In this version a logger is introduced as a better way for debuging a program errors. Now background console no longer appears on screen. Program creates a toolout.log file which can help in solving issues with program and in raporting errors.

### Airfoil Designer
Coorected an error on Showing Reference where a small name deviation in selig format caused whole program to crash. Now no 'Name:' is reqired in front of accual name.
Repaired the issue with Appending an airfoil from newer formats of program.
Hopefully a program is now more crash resistant.

... and probably added new bugs
